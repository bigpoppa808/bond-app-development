# Bond App - Comprehensive Development Plan

This document outlines the comprehensive development plan for implementing the Bond social meeting application using Flutter and Firebase. It covers architecture, folder structure, implementation phases, technical considerations, risks, and assumptions.

## 1. Project Goals

- Develop a cross-platform mobile application (iOS & Android) using Flutter.
- Implement core features: User Authentication, Profiles, Discovery, Connections, Meetings, Messaging, NFC Verification, Token Economy, Donor Subscriptions.
- Utilize Firebase for backend services (Auth, Firestore, Functions, Storage, Messaging).
- Integrate Algolia for efficient search and filtering.
- Ensure a scalable, secure, and reliable application architecture.
- Deliver an intuitive and engaging user experience based on provided wireframes and guidelines.

## 2. Project Architecture

A layered architecture using the BLoC pattern will be implemented for clear separation of concerns and testability.

## 8. Risk Management

| Risk                      | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                                                                 |
| :------------------------ | :--------- | :----- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Firebase Cost Overruns    | Medium     | Medium | Monitor usage closely, optimize Firestore queries/reads, implement caching.         |
| NFC Compatibility Issues  | Medium     | High   | Test on diverse devices early, provide alternative verification (QR code?), clear user guidance. |
| Algolia Integration Complexity | Low        | Medium | Start integration early, utilize Algolia support/docs, potentially phase rollout.   |
| Scope Creep               | Medium     | High   | Strict change management process, prioritize features based on MVP, clear phases.  |
| Performance Bottlenecks   | Medium     | High   | Regular profiling (DevTools), optimize build methods, lazy loading, background processing. |
| Security Vulnerabilities  | Low        | High   | Follow Firebase security best practices, implement App Check, secure Cloud Functions, regular audits. |
| Third-Party API Changes   | Low        | Medium | Use stable API versions, create abstraction layers, monitor vendor announcements.     |
| Platform Specific Issues  | Medium     | Medium | Test thoroughly on both iOS & Android throughout development, use platform channels carefully. |
| Team Availability/Delays  | Low        | High   | Buffer time in estimates, clear task dependencies, regular communication.             |

## 9. Assumptions

*   Firebase and Algolia free/paid tiers meet initial performance and cost requirements.
*   NFC hardware is available and functional on target user devices.
*   Required API keys (Google Maps, Stripe, etc.) will be available.
*   Wireframes and design guidelines are finalized and approved.
*   Project requirements (MD files) are stable and approved.
*   Adequate testing devices (iOS/Android) are available.

## 10. Dependencies

*   **Phase 2 depends on Phase 1:** Core architecture and authentication are prerequisites.
*   **Messaging depends on Connections:** Users must be connected to message.
*   **NFC Verification depends on Meetings:** Meetings must be scheduled to be verified.
*   **Token Awarding depends on NFC Verification:** Successful verification triggers token awards.
*   **Donor Benefits depend on Donor Subscription:** Features unlocked after successful subscription.
*   **Advanced Search depends on Algolia Integration:** Algolia service must be set up.

## 11. Review and Approval

*   **Phase Reviews:** Conduct a review at the end of each major phase with stakeholders to demonstrate progress, gather feedback, and approve continuation.
*   **Code Reviews:** Implement mandatory peer code reviews for all significant changes via Pull Requests.
*   **Design Reviews:** Ensure UI implementation matches wireframes and guidelines periodically.
