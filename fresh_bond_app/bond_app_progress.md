# Bond App Progress with Incremental Dependency Approach

This document outlines our progress in setting up a clean Flutter project with incremental dependency addition, following the recommendations from the `dependency_restoration_order.md` guide.

## Summary of Approach

We created a fresh Flutter project and added dependencies incrementally according to the phased approach recommended in the restoration plan.

## Successful Builds

Our approach successfully achieved builds with the following dependency sets:

1. **Phase 1: Core UI Framework**
   - flutter
   - cupertino_icons
   - flutter_svg

2. **Phase 2: Basic Firebase**
   - All of Phase 1
   - firebase_core: ^2.15.1

3. **Phase 4: State Management**
   - All of Phase 2
   - flutter_bloc: ^8.1.3
   - bloc: ^8.1.2
   - equatable: ^2.0.5
   - get_it: ^7.6.0

4. **Phase 5: Routing**
   - All of Phase 4
   - go_router: ^10.1.2

## Issues Encountered

We encountered issues when attempting to add the following dependencies:

1. **Phase 3: Authentication**
   - firebase_auth: ^4.9.0 and other versions
   - Issue: Lexical or Preprocessor Issue with non-modular headers inside framework modules

2. **Phase 6: Data Storage**
   - cloud_firestore: ^4.9.1
   - Issue: Unsupported -G compiler flag and missing module map files

We attempted to fix these issues by:
1. Modifying the Podfile to handle the -G flag removal
2. Creating proper xcconfig files
3. Trying to address module map issues

## Recommendations

Based on our progress, we recommend the following approach to continue development:

1. **Proceed with Functional Stack**
   - Continue development with the dependencies that successfully build (Phases 1, 2, 4, 5)
   - Use REST APIs as an alternative for Firebase Auth and Firestore functionality if needed

2. **Alternative Backend Options**
   - Consider using REST API calls instead of the native Firebase plugins
   - Evaluate other backend options like Supabase or Appwrite that might have fewer iOS build issues

3. **Further Investigation**
   - Continue working with the iOS team to investigate and resolve the module map issues
   - Consider filing issues with the Flutter Firebase plugins team
   - Experiment with alternative version combinations

## Next Steps

1. Setup basic app structure with the working dependencies
2. Implement core UI components
3. Set up state management structure
4. Configure routing
5. Implement REST API client for backend interactions as an alternative to native Firebase plugins

This incremental approach has successfully identified the problematic dependencies and allowed us to establish a working foundation for the Bond app.
