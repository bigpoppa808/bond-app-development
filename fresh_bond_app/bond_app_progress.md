# Bond App Implementation Progress Log

## Initial Approach: Incremental Dependency Addition

Our initial approach focused on setting up a clean Flutter project with incremental dependency addition, following the recommendations from the dependency restoration plan.

### Successful Builds with Limited Dependencies
- Core UI Framework (flutter, cupertino_icons, flutter_svg)
- Basic Firebase (firebase_core)
- State Management (flutter_bloc, bloc, equatable, get_it)
- Routing (go_router)

### Issues Encountered
- Firebase Authentication: Lexical or Preprocessor issues with non-modular headers
- Cloud Firestore: Unsupported -G compiler flag and missing module map files

- Implemented profile image handling

### Discovery Feature (Completed)
- Implemented discovery screens with filtering
- Created user card components with compatibility indicators
- Connected discovery with profile feature

### Connections Feature (Completed)
- Implemented connections management
- Created connection request mechanism
- Set up connections UI

### Notifications Feature (Completed)
- Designed and implemented notification models and repository
- Created notification BLoC with proper events and states
- Implemented notifications screen with grouping by date
- Connected notifications with other features

## 2025-03-30: Meetings Feature Implementation

### Completed Work
1. **Meeting Data Models**
   - Created `MeetingModel` class with serialization and validation
   - Implemented `MeetingStatus` enum with proper states (pending, confirmed, completed, canceled, rescheduled)
   - Added support for meeting metadata (creation date, updates, etc.)

2. **Repository Layer**
   - Designed `MeetingRepository` interface with comprehensive operations
   - Implemented `MeetingRepositoryImpl` using Firestore as the backend
   - Added proper error handling and validation logic
   - Implemented authorization checks to ensure users can only access their own meetings

3. **Business Logic**
   - Created `MeetingBloc` with state management using the BLoC pattern
   - Implemented various events for meeting lifecycle management:
     - `LoadMeetingEvent`, `LoadAllMeetingsEvent`, `LoadMeetingsByStatusEvent` 
     - `LoadUpcomingMeetingsEvent`, `LoadPastMeetingsEvent`
     - `CreateMeetingEvent`, `UpdateMeetingEvent`, `DeleteMeetingEvent`
     - `CancelMeetingEvent`, `ConfirmMeetingEvent`, `RescheduleMeetingEvent`, `CompleteMeetingEvent`
   - Implemented corresponding states for each operation

4. **UI Components**
   - Created `MeetingsScreen` with tabs for upcoming and past meetings
   - Implemented `MeetingDetailsScreen` showing full meeting information
   - Designed `MeetingFormScreen` for creating and editing meetings
   - Created reusable widgets like `MeetingCard` and `MeetingFilterChip`

5. **Integration**
   - Updated service locator to register MeetingRepository
   - Added meetings feature to main app router
   - Updated main shell to include meetings in navigation
   - Connected meeting feature with authentication system

6. **Testing**
   - Created comprehensive unit tests for the meeting model (`meeting_model_test.dart`)
   - Implemented thorough tests for the MeetingBloc (`meeting_bloc_test.dart`)
   - Created extensive tests for MeetingRepository (`meeting_repository_test.dart`)
   - Fixed testing issues related to datetime comparisons and error handling

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Firebase Integration**
   - Adapted query filters for Firestore compatibility
   - Fixed type conversion issues between Dart and Firestore data types
   - Implemented proper transaction handling for atomic operations

2. **Testing Challenges**
   - Fixed issues with DateTime matching in tests
   - Resolved error handling expectation mismatches
   - Improved mock implementations for more accurate testing

3. **UI Integration**
   - Ensured proper state management across multiple screens
   - Implemented proper error handling and loading states

## 2025-03-30: NFC Verification Feature Implementation

### Completed Work
1. **NFC Repository & Interface**
   - Created `NfcVerificationRepository` interface defining core NFC operations
   - Implemented repository with support for tag reading and verification
   - Added error handling and graceful degradation for unsupported devices

2. **State Management with BLoC**
   - Created `NfcVerificationBloc` with comprehensive events and states
   - Implemented session management for NFC operations
   - Added proper error handling and status reporting

3. **UI Components**
   - Designed `NfcVerificationScreen` with intuitive status visualization
   - Created visual feedback for scan success/failure
   - Implemented proper navigation and result handling

4. **Integration with Meeting Feature**
   - Connected NFC verification with meetings for in-person verification
   - Added verification option to meeting details screen
   - Implemented completion flow after successful verification

5. **iOS Configuration**
   - Added required NFC permissions to Info.plist
   - Configured tag reading capabilities
   - Added proper usage description for App Store compliance

### Challenges Encountered
1. **iOS NFC Limitations**
   - iOS restricts NFC capabilities compared to Android
   - Only supports tag reading, not peer-to-peer communication
   - Requires additional entitlements for App Store distribution

2. **Cross-Platform Support**
   - Implemented graceful degradation when NFC is unavailable
   - Created fallback mechanisms for older devices
   - Handled initialization errors without crashing

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Implemented SHA-256 hashing for verification payloads
   - Added proper validation of meeting metadata
   - Added authorization checks to ensure proper verification

### Next Steps
1. **Token Economy Feature**
   - Design token model and repository
   - Implement token earning and spending logic 
   - Create UI for token management
   - Integrate with meeting and verification features

2. **Donor Management**
   - Design donor model and relationship with users
   - Implement donation tracking and management
   - Create donor dashboard and analytics

3. **System Testing**
   - Perform complete integration testing
   - Test on various iOS devices
   - Verify all features work together correctly
