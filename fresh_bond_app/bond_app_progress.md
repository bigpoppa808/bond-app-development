## Architecture Highlights

- **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns with data, domain, and presentation layers
- **BLoC Pattern**: Used for state management throughout the app
- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data sources from business logic
- **Dependency Injection**: Using GetIt service locator for component registration
- **Interface-driven Design**: Using interfaces for repositories to allow for mocking and testing

## Technical Challenges Solved

- Created a consistent neo-glassmorphism design system
- Integrated Firebase authentication with secure token storage
- Implemented real-time messaging system
- Added token economy system with achievements
- Created a flexible connection management system

## Security Considerations

- Secure token storage
