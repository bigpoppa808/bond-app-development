## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: iOS Build Issues with Firebase

**Problem:** Initial integration of Firebase SDK caused iOS build failures due to compatibility issues.

**Solution:** 
- Implemented a REST-based approach for Firebase interactions instead of using the full SDK
- Gradually migrated to the Firebase SDK with careful testing at each step
- Created a comprehensive testing strategy for iOS builds

### Challenge 2: State Management Complexity

**Problem:** Managing complex state across multiple features proved challenging.

**Solution:**
- Adopted the BLoC pattern consistently across all features
- Implemented clear event and state hierarchies
- Used freezed for immutable state classes
- Created a standardized approach to error handling

### Challenge 3: NFC Implementation on iOS

**Problem:** iOS has strict limitations on NFC usage compared to Android.

**Solution:**
- Implemented a platform-specific approach for NFC handling
- Created a fallback mechanism for devices without NFC
- Added comprehensive documentation for iOS NFC configuration
- Used SHA-256 hashing for secure verification payloads

### Challenge 4: Performance Optimization

**Problem:** Initial implementation had performance issues with large data sets.

**Solution:**
- Implemented pagination for list views
- Added caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data
- Optimized Firebase queries with proper indexing
- Reduced unnecessary rebuilds in the UI

## Pivots & Strategic Changes

### Pivot 1: Authentication Strategy

**Initial Approach:** Started with a custom authentication system using REST APIs.

**Pivot:** Migrated to Firebase Authentication for better security and reliability.

**Reasoning:** Firebase Authentication provided a more robust solution with less maintenance overhead and better security features.

### Pivot 2: Design Language

**Initial Approach:** Standard Material Design components.

**Pivot:** Custom Neo-Glassmorphism design system with Bento Box layouts.

**Reasoning:** Created a more distinctive and modern UI that better aligned with the brand identity and provided a more engaging user experience.

### Pivot 3: Token Economy

**Initial Approach:** Basic gamification elements.

**Pivot:** Comprehensive token economy with achievements and marketplace.

**Reasoning:** Enhanced user engagement and retention through meaningful rewards and progression systems.
