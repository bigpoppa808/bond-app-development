# Bond App Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to fix compilation and runtime issues in the Bond App.

## Firebase Integration 

Fixed Firebase integration by:

1. Fixed module map issues in iOS build by creating necessary module maps for BoringSSL and other Firebase dependencies
2. Updated the main.dart file to handle Firebase initialization errors gracefully
3. Updated the Firebase options to use the correct bundle ID
4. Added missing Firebase-related Gradients in BondColors class

## Dependency Injection

Removed mock/dummy services and enabled real Firebase authentication:

1. Updated ServiceLocator to use FirebaseAuthService instead of MockAuthService
2. Updated AuthRepositoryImpl to work with the real Firebase authentication
3. Fixed token handling with proper null safety checks

## UI Component Fixes

Updated various Bond Design System components:

1. Fixed BondTypography reference issues by updating to the correct path 
2. Updated BondButton to use the updated BondTypography
3. Fixed BondAvatarSize references (changed 'large' to 'lg')
4. Fixed component references in discover_screen and home_screen

## Other Fixes

1. Added missing NotificationActionSuccessState class
2. Fixed UserModel mapping with correct property names
3. Updated import paths to use theme directory correctly

## Known Issues

iOS build still has some module map issues that may require:

1. Running the fix_firebase_build.sh script before builds
2. Manually setting up the Xcode project configuration
3. For development purposes, the Android or web platforms can be used until iOS build issues are fully resolved

## Next Steps

1. Complete implementation of Firebase Cloud Firestore integration
2. Setup proper authentication flows with Firebase Auth
3. Test all screens with real data from Firebase
