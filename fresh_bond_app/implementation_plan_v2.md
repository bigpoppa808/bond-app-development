# Bond App Implementation Plan v2

This implementation plan outlines a test-driven approach to developing the Bond app, with specific focus on avoiding iOS build issues through incremental development and frequent testing.

## Core Principles

1. **Incremental Development**: Add one dependency at a time and test thoroughly before proceeding
2. **Test Early and Often**: Implement unit, widget, and integration tests alongside feature development
3. **iOS-First Testing**: Test on iOS simulators first to catch build issues early
4. **Documentation**: Document all implementation decisions, especially workarounds for iOS issues
5. **Code Reviews**: Perform self-reviews before committing changes
